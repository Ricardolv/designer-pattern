### Creational Patterns

### Factory
#### Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory
#### Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton
#### Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Builder
#### Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
