### Creational Patterns:
#### Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

### Factory
#### Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Abstract Factory
#### Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Singleton
#### Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Builder
#### Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

---
### Prototype
#### Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

### Structural patterns: 
#### Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

### Adapter
#### Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

### Bridge
#### Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

### Composite
#### Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
